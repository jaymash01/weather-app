## Weather App

This is a desktop weather application developed using JavaFX. To run the project, follow the instructions provided at <a href="https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/">https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/</a>.

The app uses Weather API from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap</a> to get current weather data and 5 day / 3 hour forecast. You'll have to get an API key and run the app with a commandline argument which is the key you got.
